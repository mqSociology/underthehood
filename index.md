summary: This page will help you set up your computer so you can be an editor of Methods101.com. You will learn how to set up a GigHub account, install GitHub and other necessary software (like SubLime Text), and set up folders on your computer for editing the website. We will then run through basic Git Bash commands so that you can import the website, edit it in SubLime Text, and then export it back to the GitHub website.

## What are we doing?

If you are accessing this page, then you are probably helping edit the website Methods101.com

Methods101.com is a website that uses a content management system called 'Jekyll', and is hosted on a website called 'GitHub'. These are two of the most popular and stable systems for hosting websites that exist. 

The advantage of this system is that once the basic layout and files are set up, almost all the rest of the content (e.g. new webpages), can be created in simple text files and uploaded very easily. In the long run a Jekyll based system can be much faster and easier to use than something like WordPress or SquareSpace. 

However, in the short term, there is quite a steep learning curve. And you are about to enter that 'curve'. Sorry. ;)

This blog/website will hold your hand and guide you through that process, so get ready, and let's dive in.
