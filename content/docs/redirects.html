<p>Redirects are when you redirect one page to another. Currently there is a redirect in place from the Methods101 homepage (which is methods101.com) to the docs page (which is methods101.com/docs/).</p>
<p>Redirects are done in the the netifly.toml file in the root directory. In this file make sure that force is set to true. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img width='500' src='/img/redirects_01.png'/></p>
<p>The redirect is from <a href="https://methods101.com" class="uri">https://methods101.com</a> to <a href="https://methods101.com/docs/" class="uri">https://methods101.com/docs/</a>.</p>
