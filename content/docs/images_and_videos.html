<div id="images" class="section level2">
<h2>Images</h2>
<div id="where-do-they-go" class="section level3">
<h3>Where do they go?</h3>
<p>Images that you want displayed on a page must be put in the static/img folder.</p>
<p>The naming convention for the images is the file name of the Markdown page they are appearing in with an _ and then image number.</p>
<p>For example, the Markdown file for this page is called images_and_videos. So an image for this page would be called images_and_videos_01.png (file extension may be different depending on image type).</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-include-with-html" class="section level3">
<h3>How to include with HTML:</h3>
<p>Images can be included in a Markdown file in two ways.</p>
<p>The first is by using HTML in the Markdown document like so:</p>
<p><code>&lt;img alt = 'my new screenshot' width='300' src='/img/filename.png'/&gt;</code></p>
<p>The “alt = ‘my new screenshot’” provides alternative text for people who use screen readers. In this case a person with a screenreader will hear “my new screenshot.”</p>
<p>Width determines the size of the image (it keeps the same aspect ratio so changing the width changes the height proportionally).</p>
<p>Note that the file path for the image includes the img folder and has a ’ at the beginning and end.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-include-with-r-code" class="section level3">
<h3>How to include with R code:</h3>
<p>To include with R code simply use the following:</p>
<p><code>` ```` ` ```` `</code>{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=“whatever you want”, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align=“center”}</p>
<p>knitr::include_graphics(“/img/filename.png”)<code>` ```` ` ```` `</code></p>
<p>Where fig.cap gives both the alternative text for screenreaders and a text caption for the image.</p>

<div id="videos" class="section level2">
<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>To embed a YouTube video in RMarkdown use the following code:</p>
<p><code>` ```` ` ```` `</code>{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}</p>
<p>blogdown::shortcode(“youtube”, “zPrI8db74kA”)<code>` ```` ` ```` `</code></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>zPrI8db74kA</p>
<p>is taken from the url of the video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPrI8db74kA" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPrI8db74kA</a></p>
