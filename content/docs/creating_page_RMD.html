<h2>Markdown vs RMarkdown</h2>
<p>RMarkdown is a version of Markdown that lets you render the output of R code that is inserted into the page. The file extension that we use for RMarkdown file is .RMD as opposed to .MD for Markdown files.</p>
<p>RMarkdown files must be created in conjunction with RStudio for them to work (more on this later).</p>
<p>Most commands/syntax that applies to Markdown also applies to RMarkdown.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-and-updating-a-page" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating and updating a page</h2>
<p>Creating a new page is easy, simply create a new file in Notepad ++ (or your preferred text editor) and make sure to save it with an .RMD file extension. The file should be saved in the contents folder.</p>
<p>Note: <em>the file name will become the page address so a file named <strong>about</strong> will have the URL of</em> <a href="https://methods101.com/about" class="uri">https://methods101.com/about</a>.</p>
<p>The page should have appropriate front matter (which is discussed more [here]({{&lt; ref “/docs/front_matter.MD” &gt;}}) ).</p>
<p><strong>This part must be done each time you update a page or create a new page.</strong> Before the file is pushed to the github repository (which is discussed [here]({{&lt; ref “/docs/using_the_command_console.MD” &gt;}})) you must use RStudio to create a HTML file to match the RMarkdown file. This is simple. Open the project-kickstart-R file located in the root directory of the repository with RStudio:</p>
<p><img width='500' src='/img/creating_page_RMD_01.jpg'/></p>
<p>From the console in RStudio you must run:</p>
<ul>
<li>blogdown::serve_site()</li>
</ul>
<p>Which will result in something similar to the following:</p>
<p><img width='500' src='/img/creating_page_RMD_02.png'/></p>
<p>The HTML files will be created and the page or the changes to the page are ready to be sent to the github repository.</p>
<p>Note: the <em>blogdown::serve_site()</em> will also run a local version of the site on your computer that you can access in your browser with the address shown in orange. In this case it is <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4321" class="uri">http://127.0.0.1:4321</a> . This allows you to see how your changes have effected the site without actually pushing them to the live github version.</p>
