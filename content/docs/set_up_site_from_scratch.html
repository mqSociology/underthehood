<h1>Step 1: Create a Gmail</h1>
<p>You want to sent up a brand new gmail account for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It will mean you will have a Gmail, Github, and Netlify accounts for your organisation and the website which you can share and transfer with other members of the organisation (or collaborators) without compromising your own personal gmail/github/netlify account.</li>
<li>Netlify has a limit of one free netlify hosting per Github account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Go to www.gmail.com and create a new email address.</p>
<p>You will need a mobile phone number to send an SMS to for verification of your identity.</p>

<div id="step-2-create-a-github-account" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 2: Create a Github account</h1>
<p>Now go to www.github.com and set up a normal free Github account.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-clone-the-methods101-template-or-whatever" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 3: Clone the methods101 template (or whatever)</h1>
<p>BEFORE creating a new repository, follow these steps</p>
<p>When logged into your Github account:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click on the plus sign (+) in the top right hand corner of the github screen</li>
<li>Select “Import repository”</li>
<li>On the next page there are two boxes you need to fill out.
<ul>
<li>Under the 2nd set of boxes “Your new repository details”, insert the name of your repository in the box below “Name”</li>
<li>In the 1st box “Your old repository’s clone URL”, you will need to get the clone URL from your old repository (e.g. methods101.com) by following the steps in these instructions: <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository" class="uri">https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="step-4-create-netlify-account" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 4: Create Netlify account</h1>
<p>Go to Netlify and log in with your Github account.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On the main page of your account, in the “Sites” tab, click “New site from Git” button in the top right corner.</li>
<li>On the next page called “Create a new site”, under “Continuous Deployment”, click “Github”</li>
<li>You will be asked to authorise Netlify to access your account, so click the green button “Authorise Netlify by Netlify”</li>
<li>Change the next page first button selection to “Only select repositories”, and then in the pull down menu select the repository you want to launch/host. And then click “Install”.</li>
<li><p>It should then go to the the third stage of setting up called “2. Build options and deploy!” [NOTE: We had trouble here, but just reloaded the pages, and then clicked on “New site from Git” and then went straight to “3. Build options, and deploy”] Default settings here should be fine:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are the owner,</li>
<li>branch is master,</li>
<li>build command is hugo,</li>
<li>public director is public.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Click “Deploy site.”
6. It will now show “Site deploy in progress”. Click on “General”, and under “Site details” and “Site information”, click the button “Change site name” =, and change the name to some name you want (e.g. sydnet, so now the basic domain name deployed by netlify is hosted at: sydnet.netlify.com )</p>

<div id="step-6-buy-a-website" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 6: Buy a website</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We used Godaddy.com</li>
<li>We bought a .org or .com domain because .au domains can’t be bought by private individuals. The alternative is to set up as a sole trader with the austrlaian government and then have an ABN.</li>
</ol>
