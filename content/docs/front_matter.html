<p>Front matter adds metadata to the page and also serves to toggle existing layouts (like table of contents). It is essential to every page. For more front matter variables/options go <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The front matter we use follows the yaml format and should look something like this:</p>
<p><img width='400' src='/img/basics_of_content_creation_01.png'/></p>
<p>Note the three dashes at the beginning and end. This signifies the beginning and end of the front matter. Front matter must be at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Running through the front matter from top to bottom:</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>Title:</strong> </span> This is the big title that appears at the top of the page</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>Lastmod:</strong> </span> This tells the reader and content creators the last time this page was modified. This is automatically done by Hugo. You do not need to enter this in yourself.</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>Draft:</strong> </span> Set to false this does nothing. If set to true it will hide the page from users.</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>Maths:</strong> </span> This should be set to true.</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>The following renders the table of contents (if you don’t want a table of contents don’t include this):</strong> </span></p>
<p><img width='300' src='/img/basics_of_content_creation_02.png'/></p>
<p>Note: this method of inserting a table of contents will only work for RMarkdown files and not Markdown files. Additionally, the table of contents is rendered from heading levels 1 through 3.</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>Linktitle:</strong> </span> This is the menu entry for the page.</p>
<p><span style="color:maroon"> <strong>The following specifies where in the menu and which menu it appears in:</strong> </span></p>
<p><img width='300' src='/img/basics_of_content_creation_03.png'/></p>
