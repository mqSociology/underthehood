Redirects are when you redirect one page to another. Currently there is a redirect in place from the Methods101 homepage (which is methods101.com) to the docs page (which is methods101.com/docs/). 

Redirects are done in the the netifly.toml file in the root directory. In this file make sure that force is set to true. It should look like this:

<img width='500' src='/img/redirects_01.png'/>

The redirect is from https://methods101.com to https://methods101.com/docs/.
