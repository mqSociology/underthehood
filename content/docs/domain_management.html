<p>Domain management is done through Netlify. Once logged in on the methods101 account go to the domain settings page shown below:</p>
<p><img width='800' src='/img/domain_management_01.png'/></p>
<p>Under the custom domains heading you will see three website addresses.</p>
<p>The default subdomain is the address that Netlify gives you. Netlify can give you a .netlify.com address which is undesirable for a professional page. For Methods101 a domain name was purchased (which is the one currently used).</p>
<p>The primary domain is the one that was purchased for the site. It is easily set by pressing the setting button on the right (the three little dots).</p>
<p>The address needs to be made secure which is done through the HTTPS page under the Domain Management tab on the sidemenu. Set custom certificate and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>(This page needs work and the Netlify documentation may be more useful right now. If someone needs to do this again please update the page with better instructions).</p>
