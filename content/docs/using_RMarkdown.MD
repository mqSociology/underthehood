## Markdown vs RMarkdown

RMarkdown is a version of Markdown that lets you render the output of R code that is inserted into the page. The file extension that we use for RMarkdown file is .RMD as opposed to .MD for Markdown files. 

RMarkdown files must be created in conjunction with RStudio for them to work.
