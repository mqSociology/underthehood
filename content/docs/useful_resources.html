<p>Some useful resources for managing content:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown cheat sheet</a> there are many more of these that can be found through google.</p></li>
<li><p>{RMarkdown cheat sheet] (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown</a>) again there are many more of these</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/">Academic theme documentation</a> I believe this was geared towards Markdown users and not RMarkdown users</p></li>
<li><p>I encourage you to look at the Stackoverflow forums when googling a problem</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3Schools</a> has a pretty good list of CSS variables if you are looking to modify your content with some inline CSS styling (not normally recommended but useful for little things like changing the colour of text)</p></li>
</ul>
