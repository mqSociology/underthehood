<p>The config.toml file holds many global variables for the site. Be careful what you change here because it can cause significant problems. If setting up a site for the fist time many of these settings will need to be changed. Variables of interest in no particular order are:</p>
<p><strong>baseurl:</strong> this tells Hugo what the root address of your site is. This affects things like the preview of the site shown when sending a Whatsapp or Facebook message with the website URL in it. Baseurl also affects linking pages internally as shown [here.]({{&lt; ref “/docs/hyperlinks.MD” &gt;}})</p>
<p><strong>title:</strong> this is what will appear in the topbar on the left. Currently Methods101 does not have this activated and instead we have a logo in its place (this is a separate variable talked about later)</p>
<p><strong>color_theme:</strong> lets you choose which colour theme will be used to colour the site. We use our own called MQtheme. These themes are located at -academic and the custom themes here are probably the only files that should ever be changed in the  folder.</p>
<p><strong>custom_css:</strong> designates the file that will overwrite the theme css file. This should be left alone (the config entry not the css file).</p>
<p><strong>logo:</strong> if this has an entry (for Methods101 it does) then it will override the title variable described above. The entry should be the name of the image in the  folder that you want to be the logo.</p>
<p><strong>Description for social sharing and search engines:</strong> is the description that will come up when sharing the website in social media including in messaging apps such as Whatsapp.</p>
<p>Further down you will find the # Navigation Links heading in the config file (line 293 as of writing this page). Under this you will see the menu entries for the topbar and for the parent tabs in the sidemenu.</p>
<p>There are many other variables in the config file that can be read about in the Academic theme documentation <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/">here</a> or by doing a google search. For the most part the only things that should need to regularly be changed are the menu entries.</p>
