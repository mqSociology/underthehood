Domain management is done through Netlify. Once logged in on the methods101 account go to the domain settings page shown below:

Under the custom domains heading you will see three website addresses.

The default subdomain is the address that Netlify gives you. Netlify can give you a .netlify.com address which is undesirable for a professional page. For Methods101 a domain name was purchased (which is the one currently used). 

The primary domain is the one that was purchased for the site. It is easily set by pressing the setting button on the right (the three little dots).

The address needs to be made secure which is done through the HTTPS page under the Domain Management tab on the sidemenu. Set custom certificate and follow the instructions.

(This page needs work and the Netlify documentation may be more useful right now. If someone needs to do this again please update the page with better instructions).
