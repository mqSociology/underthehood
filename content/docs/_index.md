Underthehood is a documentation site for methods101.com. The purpose of this site is to provide a guide to future content creators and website administrators of methods101.com. The hope is that this will answer any questions and provide solutions to common problems that are encountered in the course of adapting and changing this site and can potentially be used by others at Macquarie University who are looking to set up their own site. 

**For new website content creators** who haven't used github, gitbash, and Markdown before, it is recommended you read through each of the pages under the Getting Started menu tab on the left first.
