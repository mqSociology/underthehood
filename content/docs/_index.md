Underthehood is a documentation site for methods101.com. The purpose of this site is to provide a guide to future content creators and website administrators of methods101.com. The hope is that this will answer any questions and provide solutions to common problems that are encountered in the course of adapting and changing this site and can potentially be used by others at Macquarie University who are looking to set up their own site. 

**At the very least** it is recommended that you look at the Introduction page under the Getting Started tab on the left. This page will outline which programs you will need to get started and which packages for RStudio you will need.

**For new website content creators** who haven't used github, gitbash, and Markdown before, it is recommended you read through each of the pages under the Getting Started menu tab on the left first.

### Site navigation

**Getting started** tab has a basic tutorial for creating and uploading content for the website. 

**Website Management** tab covers the following:

* How the website is setup (where it is hosted, how it is deployed, what Hugo is, etc.)

* What the config.toml file is and a rundown of some useful variables contained withing

* How to manage redirects

* What changes have been made to the css and HTML and how to go about this yourself

* Other relevant matters

**Content management** tab covers the following:

* How to create a RMarkdown file (regular content) and why we use them 

* What front matter is and why it is important

* How to create menu entries

* How to insert images and videos 

* Other useful things
